        "1. The paper aims to shine a light on what efficient and easy data tidying should look like describing the benefits of a uniform structure and showing a case study as proof. It hopes to prove a point about how good structure makes the entire job of data cleaning easier.\n",
        "2. Tidy data standard was designed to reduce the amount of time spent data cleaning and create a structure that is easy to follow and systematic so data scientists can focus on the actual problem quicker.\n",
        "3. The first sentence means that while tidy datasets have a lot of commonalities that aren't shocking or extremely unique, messy ones do present a lot of unique features. And often times with high variability, more attention and work is needed to standardize the quirks of each messy dataset. Instead of being able to work with something familiar, instead you're faced with something new everytime. The second sentence means that when viewing data, its usually easier to attribute data to whether they are an observation or a variable just by the nature and our pre-existing knowledge of tables/matrices. This is because its easier to understand the difference values of the same attribute like ones age typically represented in a column versus an observation like a person, which is the make up of all their individual values. The sentence is saying that what's not easy, on the other hand, is uncovering the specific semantic meaning observations and variables. Take a person again, for example. an observation could simply be the person as they are and their attributes or the observation could be everytime a person performed an action. In the first, a person can only be observed once while in the second, they could be observed numerous times. This feels very hard to distinguish by looking at the data of people alone especially as they data gets larger and it becomes harder to realize \"duplicate\" people.\n",
        "4. Wickham defines a value as usually either a number of a string, distinguishing between qualitative data and quantitative data. He defines a variable as containing the valuess of a single attribute like height or weight while an observation contains all the attributes and their values on the same unit.\n",
        "5. Tidy data is defined as following the rules that each variable forms a column, each observation forms a row, and each type of observational unit forms a table.\n",
        "6. The five most common problems with messy datasets as listed in Section 3 are 1. column headers are values instead of variable names, 2. multiple variables are stored in columns, 3. variables are stored in both rows and columns, 4. multiple types of observational units are stored in the same table, 5. a single observational unit is stored in multiple tables. The data in Table 4 are messy because the columns are values and not variable names. Melting a dataset would be to turn the columns into rows typically for a variable spread across columns and instead giving it its own column to create true observations.\n",
        "7. Table 11 is messy because it has multiple observational types in it tmax and tmin each with their own row. Table 12 is tidy because tmax and tmin are moved to columns containg their values instead normalizing the data and it is molten because instead of having each day be its own column stretched the table, the vatiable is moved to its own column as it should and combined with the year and month columns to just make the date variable.\n",
        "8. The chicken-and-egg problem with tidy data is that tidy data is the egg and data tools is the chicken where the tools give birth to the data as the data is only as good as the tools so creating and improving tidy tools is inherent to tidy data creating the paradox. Wickham hopes that in the future, others will build on to his tidy data framework and break out of this \"local maxima\"s he puts it developing even better data storage strategies and tools."

This is because we might want to look at the correlations between a provoked or unprovoked attack and the other data. As for \"Water Disaster,\" the types generalized to this new type were all either synonymous or misspellings of another. The other types that were removed were done so because they were labeled either as inconclusive or invalid so we marked them all with NaNs because we don't want to use any invalid data when analyzing."

        "3. Please provide a constructive criticism of how the Census was conducted: What was done well? What do you think was missing? How should future large scale surveys be adjusted to best reflect the diversity of the population? Could some of the Census' good practices be adopted more widely to gather richer and more useful data?\n",
